Como fã não tem como dizer que a série é perfeita, mas fiquei bem satisfeita só de ter um live action. Infelizmente cenas incríveis como a despedida de Sanji e toda a trama de Usopp foram bem inferiores ao que poderia ser. Minha esperança é que Usopp se destaque mais nos próximos episódios. Iñaki Godoy é carisma puro, representando muito bem Luffy, apesar de não achar ele 100% Luffy não tem como se decepcionar com esse menino! Zoro tem seus problemas na adaptação, mas a escolha do ator pra mim foi muito boa e entendo algumas mudanças. Nami é a personagem que menos gosto no anime, porém ela conseguiu me fazer gostar bem mais no live action. Sinto falta de Sanji ser gado demais, mas espero que aprimore essa característica fundamental nas próximas temporadas. ABSURDAMENTE ansiosa por Chopper, Brook, Nico e Frank!"},
